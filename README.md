# 📈 Store Item Sales Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **forecasting store item sales** using historical sales data. The goal is to predict future demand for products across different stores and items by applying **time series analysis and predictive modeling techniques**.

Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses:

* Optimize inventory levels
* Reduce overstock and stockouts
* Improve supply chain and operational planning
* Support data-driven business decisions

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains historical sales records with the following key attributes:

* **Store ID** – Identifier for each store
* **Item ID** – Identifier for each product
* **Date** – Sales date
* **Sales** – Number of items sold

The data is structured as a **time series**, enabling trend, seasonality, and pattern analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze historical sales patterns
* Identify trends and seasonality in sales data
* Build predictive models for future sales
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Modeling:** Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Date parsing and sorting
   * Aggregation by store and item

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Sales trend analysis
   * Seasonality and pattern detection
   * Distribution analysis

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Time-based features (day, month, year)
   * Lag features and rolling statistics

4. **Modeling & Prediction**

   * Time series forecasting models
   * Baseline and advanced predictive approaches

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   * RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   * MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

---

## 📊 Results & Insights

* Identified clear **seasonal patterns** in item sales
* Certain items show consistent growth or decline trends
* Predictive models provide reliable short-term forecasts

These insights can be leveraged to improve inventory and sales strategies.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Implement advanced models (XGBoost, LSTM)
* Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
* Deploy the model using an API or dashboard
* Add external factors (promotions, holidays)
